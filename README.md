I don't believe that chicken nuggets and boneless chicken wings are not the same thing. Chicken nuggets and blended up chicken meat and bonless wings is chicken breast. 

This is a cool thought. 
I love both tho LOL

I never thought about it like that.

I agree. Although chicken nuggets to me are juicier.
